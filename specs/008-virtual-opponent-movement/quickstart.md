# Quickstart: Virtual Opponent Movement

## Prerequisites
- Run the app locally (existing instructions in README).

## Manual Verification

### Scenario 1: Human-like movement
1. Start a singleplayer match with at least one virtual opponent.
2. Observe opponents for 2–3 minutes.
3. Confirm they move purposefully, pursue targets, and do not remain idle.

### Scenario 2: Behavior variety
1. Continue the same match for 10 minutes.
2. Confirm each opponent changes direction or target at least once every 20 seconds.
3. Confirm no opponent remains stationary for more than 15 seconds while alive.

### Scenario 3: Menu isolation
1. While opponents are active, attempt to pause, restart, or quit.
2. Confirm only the player can trigger these actions and no bot action triggers menus.
